## Acknowledgments 🤝

- First, I want to express my gratitude to <a href="https://github.com/migueravila/Flowetch">Flowfetch</a> for being a source of inspiration for this project.
- I also want to thank my girlfriend, who introduced me to Houseki no Kuni. The anime's gem-inspired theme sparked the idea to create a fetch tool with a gem aesthetic.

## About ✨
This is a simple yet fun project, and I'm excited to share it as my first contribution to crates.io ^^
