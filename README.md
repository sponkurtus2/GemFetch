## What does GemFetch do ‚ùì
GemFetch is a command-line system information tool written in Rust that displays information about your operating system, software, and hardware in an aesthetic and visually pleasing way.

The overall purpose of GemFetch is to be used in screenshots of your system. 

The information is displayed alongside a simple ASCII art design, providing a clean and minimalist view of your system's key details.

## Acknowledgments ü§ù

- First, I want to express my gratitude to <a href="https://github.com/migueravila/Flowetch">Flowfetch</a> for being a source of inspiration for this project.
- I also want to thank my girlfriend, who introduced me to Houseki no Kuni. The anime's gem-inspired theme sparked the idea to create a fetch tool with a gem aesthetic.

## About ‚ú®
This is a simple yet fun project, and I'm excited to share it as my first contribution to crates.io ^^
